# Sneakerhead E-commerce Store

This project has the responsive screens made with HTML, CSS and JS. I have used [SpaceUI](https://zen-bartik-5ee75e.netlify.app/) component library to build these screens.

It has following screens as of now:

- Landing Page
- Product List page
- Signup and Login Pages
- Wishlist Page
- Cart Page   

Visit [this](https://keen-pasteur-021d2b.netlify.app/) link to see the hosted version of the screens.
