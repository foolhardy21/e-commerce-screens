# Sneakerhead E-commerce Store

This project has the responsive screens made with HTML, CSS and JS. Visit [this](https://keen-pasteur-021d2b.netlify.app/) link to see the hosted version of these screens.

It has following screens:

- Landing Page
- Product List page with Filter Component
- Signup and Login Pages
- Wishlist Page
- Cart Page   

I have used [SpaceUI](https://github.com/foolhardy21/component-library) component library to build these screens. 

To run this project locally, fork and clone this repo and run `index.html` in your browser.
